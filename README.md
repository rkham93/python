All my python codes
This repo consists of a game collection. 
The aim is to have a collection of CLI games to play. 
Progress: 
1. Two games in place:  
    Mad Lib
    Guess the number
2. There are two themes in Madlibs
3. Guess the number games has a fixed range of 10,20.
4. By running app.py in the root folder, a game of choice can be selcted and played.

Todo:
1. Create a scoreboard manager to manage the scores by different users. 
2. Themes in Madlibs should be increased to 5.
3. Give the option to exit the game at any point.
4. Give the option to listen to the rules at any point.
5. Have the utilities now limited to madlibs to be used for all the games.

Ambitious:
1. Create a server that connects to a front end (hopefully hosted) to either play the game or just to show the global score card.
